# This is my cv repo

In this repo are the essential files for building a page with my cv. All the info are located in the [_data/details.yml](https://github.com/elias2500/cv-1/blob/master/_data/details.yml) file. 
In the [_config.yml](https://github.com/elias2500/cv-1/blob/master/_config.yml) are some settings, like the github pages theme. The [index.html](https://github.com/elias2500/cv-1/blob/master/index.html)
file provides the basic code for the site, like some static code, maybe some headers or some paragraphs. To build the page, github pages, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) are used. Most of the work is done
locally using git and is then pushed to GitHub. GitHub pages automatically builds and makes the changes live on the site. This is an ongoing project and like anything called a "project" it will never
be finished :D.
