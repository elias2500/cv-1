        title: Career Profile
        summary: I am a student currently studying informatics at Ionian University and I am in the third year of the four year coriculum.
      I am interested in many fields of informatics but I consider myself a good and talented programmer, especially when it comes
      to problems that require math. I aspire to work in the field of informatics and be a valuable member of any group. I am a hard
      worker and stuborn when it comes to finishing a project or finding the solution. My dream is to become a video game designer, 
      because I am very interested in things like physics, animation, new technologies and inovation in video games.
